# Review Pull Request

Conduct comprehensive code review for pull requests with structured fix tracking.

## Usage

```bash
/review-pr 42
/review-pr https://github.com/{{REPO_OWNER}}/{{PROJECT_NAME}}/pull/42
```

## Rules

[Coding Standards](../rules-snippets/patterns.md)

## Orchestrator Checkpoint

> **🛑 For large PRs** (10+ files or 3+ domains): Dispatch specialist reviewers in parallel:
>
> - **Backend Architect** → architecture, API design, database
> - **Frontend Developer** → UI, components, accessibility
> - **Reviewer** → code quality, SOLID, DRY
> - **Documenter** → documentation completeness
>   Each reviewer returns findings independently; the orchestrator merges results.
>   See `.github/instructions/subagent-workflow.instructions.md` for patterns.

## Process

1. **Load PR Context**:
   - Get PR details (title, description, changed files)
   - Extract issue reference if available
   - Get PR diff and file changes
   - **CRITICAL — Comment Retrieval Strategy** (use this exact order):
     1. **Use GitHub MCP tools** (preferred) to retrieve ALL comments:
        - `mcp_github_github_pull_request_read` — get PR details and review comments
        - `github-pull-request_activePullRequest` — get the active PR context
        - Fetch **top-level PR comments** (issue-level comments on the PR conversation)
        - Fetch **inline review comments** (comments on specific lines of code)
        - Fetch **pending review comments** (from in-progress reviews)
      2. **If MCP tools fail or return no comments**, fall back to `gh` CLI:

         ```bash
         # Top-level conversation comments (often missed!)
         gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr_number}/comments
         # Review comments (inline on code)
         gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/comments
         # Reviews themselves (contain top-level review bodies)
         gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr_number}/reviews
         ```

      3. **Always check BOTH** top-level issue comments AND inline review comments — agents commonly miss top-level comments by only checking review comments
   - Identify which comments are **unresolved/open** vs already resolved

2. **Review PR Comments from ALL Reviewers**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Use `manage_todo_list` tool to create comprehensive todo list
   - Extract and categorize ALL **unresolved/open** PR comments by severity:
     - Critical (blocking issues)
     - High Priority (should be fixed before merge)
     - Medium Priority (important improvements)
   - For each comment:
     - Summarize the reviewer's feedback
     - Assess confidence in the resolution — can you fix this with high confidence?
     - **If the comment is unclear, ambiguous, or you cannot determine the right fix**:
       - **STOP and ask the user for clarification** before proceeding
       - Present 2-3 recommended solutions with trade-offs for each
       - Explain what you understand and what is unclear
       - Do NOT guess at a fix when the intent is ambiguous
     - If confident, propose a resolution plan with 99.9% confidence level
     - Add to todo list with appropriate status

3. **Verify Requirements**:
   - Read specification if linked
   - Check task completion against acceptance criteria
   - Verify all requirements met

4. **Code Quality & Best Practices**:

   ### Architecture & Patterns
   - [ ] Follows project architecture from `AGENTS.md`
   - [ ] Uses established patterns
   - [ ] Proper separation of concerns
   - [ ] Modularity and clear component boundaries
   - [ ] No code duplication

   ## Fixes Applied

   _After fixes are implemented, populate this table with every change made:_

   | File              | Issue                           | Fix                              |
   | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | `ExampleFile.php` | Missing import → fatal error    | Added `use Namespace\ClassName;` |
   | `ExampleFile.php` | Unreachable code after `return` | Removed dead `break` statements  |
   | `AnotherFile.php` | Field missing from `$casts`     | Added `'field' => 'datetime'`    |

   Every fix must appear in this table — one row per file+issue pair.
   ```

9. **Report Review Status**:
   - Review decision with clear justification
   - Summary of key findings by severity
   - Inline comments for specific code locations
   - Todo list status showing progress
   - Next steps if changes requested

10. **Confirm Execution Plan**
    - If there are changes, ask the user to confirm the execution plan with a (Y/n)

11. **If the plan is confirmed, proceed with fix Tracking with Internal Todo List**:
    - **Before Starting Work**:
      - Use `manage_todo_list` to create comprehensive list of ALL fixes:
        - PR comments requiring fixes (by severity)
        - Code quality issues
        - Potential bugs or security concerns
        - Performance improvements
    - **During Implementation**:
      - Mark ONE todo as `in-progress` before starting
      - Complete the specific fix
      - Test the fix (if applicable)
      - Mark todo as `completed` IMMEDIATELY after finishing
      - Move to next todo and repeat
    - **Never batch completions** - mark each done immediately

12. **Resolve PR Comment Threads After Fixing**:
    - **CRITICAL**: After each comment is addressed and the fix is pushed:
      1. **Resolve the comment thread** via GitHub MCP tools or API:
         - Use `mcp_github_github_pull_request_review_write` to submit a review resolving threads
         - Or reply to each resolved thread with a brief summary of what was fixed
         - Or use `gh api` to resolve conversation threads:
           ```bash
           # Reply to a review comment indicating resolution
           gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
             -f body="Fixed: [brief description of the fix applied]"
           ```
      2. **If a comment could NOT be addressed**:
         - Reply to the thread explaining why (e.g., out of scope, needs more context, trade-off decision)
         - Ask the user whether to leave it open or resolve with an explanation
      3. **Verify resolution** — after pushing, confirm the comment threads show as resolved in the PR
